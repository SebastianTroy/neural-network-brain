AI has been a subject area which I have always been curious about,
however I always thought that people were going about it the worng way.

I can see why my approach hasn't been used, but it always seemed intuative to me
that in order to mimic a human intelligence closely, a human like 'brain' of sorts is needed!

Not really anything mind blowing, but this lead to my next idea, the human brain was evolved over
literally a couple of billion of years, starting in extremely simple organisms as a clump of nerves.
So why start from the top down? Why attempt to build a complex brain from scratch, why not start off
with a simple network, of simplified nerves and, as a proof of concept, evolve some sort "brain"
capable of taking inputs from stimulus and producing relevant outputs. A simple in-out cause and effect
approach.

This clearly isn't going to evolve a complex mind, as these neural networks are far more simple than
the biology that evolved real brains, and the challenges the brains are evolving to solve are also
far simpler than the ones faced by early life but it is hopefully enough to get some interesting
results.

My plan is to create a web of neurons which are interconnected and enclosed within a NeuralWeb class,
the only way to interact with the neurons would be through either a "Sensor" which would send 
binary signals into the brain and an "Effector" which recieves binary signals from the brain and
acts accordingly.

What the sensors and effectors do is incosequential to the neural web, they simply input a signal into
one neuron in the brain, and effectors receive binary signals from a single neuron. An advanced sensor
like an eye for example could be made up of many "Rod" sensors which in turn only detect a single pixel.
